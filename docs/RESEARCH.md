# Nomad2026 - Research & Documentation

## Overview

Nomad is an open-source editor for the **Nord Modular G1** synthesizer, originally developed
between 2002-2008 and updated in 2019. This document compiles all technical research for
reimplementing the editor in JUCE/C++ as a universal application.

## Hardware Specifications (Nord Modular G1)

### DSP & Processing
- **4 x Motorola 56303 DSP** chips (standard), expandable to **8 DSPs** via Voice Expansion Board
- **96 kHz** internal sample rate, **24-bit** processing
- DAC: 18-bit / 96 kHz | ADC: 16-bit / 48 kHz
- Each patch is confined to **one DSP** — cannot span multiple DSPs (G1 limitation vs G2)
- 4 DSPs maps naturally to 4 slots, but DSP resources are shared dynamically — not a fixed 1:1 assignment
- With the Voice Expansion (8 DSPs), you still have 4 slots but more DSP headroom per slot
- Polyphony is dynamic: simple patches up to ~32 voices, complex patches may use a full DSP per voice

### Variants
| Model | DSPs | Slots | Knobs | Keys | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|-------|------|-------|
| Nord Modular Keyboard | 4 (exp. to 8) | 4 | 23 assignable | 25 (velocity) | Full-size unit |
| Nord Modular Rack | 4 (exp. to 8) | 4 | 23 assignable | — | Same as Key minus keyboard |
| Nord Micro Modular | 1 (fixed) | 1 | 4 + 1 button | — | Half-rack, monotimbral |

### Memory & Storage
- **9 banks x 99 patches** = 891 slots (storage depends on patch complexity)
- Patches stored in flash memory (no battery backup needed)
- Performance slots can combine up to 4 patches (one per slot)
- Micro Modular: reduced storage capacity

### I/O
- Audio: stereo in/out (line-level), headphone out
- MIDI: standard In/Out + dedicated "PC" In/Out for editor SysEx traffic
- Pedal inputs: sustain + expression (Key/Rack only)
- All knobs and parameters send/receive MIDI CC

### Firmware History
- OS v2.1, v3.0: added modules, Mac OS 8.6+ support
- **OS v3.03** (2000, final): added 16-band vocoder, 14-band filter bank, ring modulator, new EQ modules
- Device types in protocol: `0x00` = Keyboard, `0x01` = Rack, `0x02` = Micro Modular

### G1 vs G2 Limitations
- No MIDI Out or CV/Gate output modules (G2 added these)
- No DSP-intensive effects (reverb, long delays) — G2 added them
- Single-DSP per patch — G2 could allocate multiple DSPs per patch
- G1 multi-DSP usage requires multiple slots + physical audio cables between them

## 3. Nord Modular MIDI Protocol (v3.03)

### SysEx Envelope
```
0xF0  0x33  0x06  [cc:5][slot:2]  [payload...]  0xF7
```
- Manufacturer ID: `0x33` (Clavia)
- Device type: `0x06`
- `cc`: 5-bit command code
- `slot`: 2-bit slot selector (0-3)
- All data fields use **7-bit encoding** (MSB always 0) for MIDI compatibility
- Checksums: `sum_of_bytes % 128`

### Command Codes (cc field)

| cc | Message Type | Purpose |
|----|-------------|---------|
| 0x00 | IAm | Device identification / handshake |
| 0x13 | Parameter | Real-time parameter changes |
| 0x14 | NMInfo | Synth state feedback (voices, slots, lights, meters) |
| 0x16 | ACK | Command acknowledgments |
| 0x17 | PatchHandling | Patch editing operations |
| 0x1c-0x1f | PatchPacket | Multi-packet patch transfer (first/last flags in cc) |

### Device Identification (IAm)
- **PC sends**: `sender=0, versionHigh=3, versionLow=3`
- **Synth responds**: `sender=1` + serial number + device ID
- Device types: `0x00` = NM Keyboard, `0x01` = NM Rack, `0x02` = Micro Modular

### Parameter Change Message
```
cc=0x13, sc=0x40: section:7 module:7 parameter:7 value:7
```
- section: 0=common voice area, 1=poly voice area (verified from Java Format.java)
- module: module index (0-127)
- parameter: parameter index (0-127)
- value: parameter value (0-127)

### Cable Connection Message
```
cc=0x17, sc=0x50: section color module1 type1 connector1 module2 type2 connector2
```

### New Module Message
Encoded as `cc=0x1f`, containing embedded patch sections:
- Section 48 (SingleModule): type, section, index, xpos, ypos, name
- Section 82 (CableDump): empty cable section
- Section 77 (ParameterDump): default parameter values
- Section 91 (CustomDump): custom values
- Section 90 (NameDump): module name

### Note Message (virtual keyboard)
```
cc=0x17, payload: pid 0x56 onOff note    (onOff: 0 = note-on, 1 = note-off)
```
Plays/releases notes on the slot's patch through the PC port (which ignores plain MIDI
channel messages). No velocity on the wire. Captured from the original Clavia editor's
keyboard floater and hardware-verified (the editor also sends off+on pairs when changing
notes in drone mode). Sniffing technique: the Wine editor exposes an ALSA seq client
("WINE midi driver"), so `aseqdump -p <client>:1` shows its TX directly.

Hardware-tested dead ends (2026-06-11), do not retry:
- `NoteEvent` (sc=0x41, vel/onoff/note) is **incoming-only** — the synth reports keyboard
  notes with it but refuses it as input with error 5 ("no slot focused"), even right after
  an `ActivateSlot` (PatchCommand 0x41/0x09); that attempt left the synth in an error state.
- CC 120/123 (all sound/notes off) on any channel are ignored by the PC port.
- The front-panel panic is internal: it emits nothing on the PC port and has no protocol
  equivalent, so stuck MIDI IN notes cannot be cleared by an editor.

### NMInfo Subcommands (sc field)

| sc | Message | Content |
|----|---------|---------|
| 0x05 | VoiceCount | 4x 7-bit voice counts per slot |
| 0x07 | SlotsSelected | 4 slot selection bits |
| 0x09 | SlotActivated | Active slot index |
| 0x25 | KnobAssignment | Knob-to-parameter mapping |
| 0x27 | SetPatchTitle | Null-terminated string (16 chars max) |
| 0x33 | SetModuleTitle | section:7 module:7 + null-terminated string (16 chars max) |
| 0x39 | Lights | 20x 2-bit LED state values |
| 0x3a | Meters | 5 pairs of 7-bit values |
| 0x40 | KnobChange | section/module/parameter/value |
| 0x7e | Error | 7-bit error code |

### What the synth does NOT report

- **Where a patch came from.** Loading a patch from the front panel produces only
  `NMInfo sc=0x38 NewPatchInSlot` (slot + pid), which says *which slot changed* and
  nothing about the bank position. The `PatchLoadResponse` ACK (type 0x38: slot in
  pid2, section/position in the payload) that `midi.pdl2` documents was never
  observed on hardware for a front-panel load, and nmedit parses it but never uses
  it. The editor therefore has to infer a location by matching the patch name
  against the bank list, and cannot when the name is not unique (verified on a real
  G1, 2026-08-12).

### What the editor cannot drive

- **Panel LEDs.** The front panel does light up on its own: assigning a parameter to a
  knob turns that knob's LED green, and removing the assignment turns it off (confirmed
  on hardware, 2026-08-17). But there is no message for it. `Lights` (sc=0x39, 20x 2-bit)
  is an **NMInfo** subcommand, i.e. synth → editor, and it reports the state of the
  *patch's* module LEDs that the DSP computes, not the panel. Nothing in `midi.pdl2`
  goes the other way. Driving panel LEDs would mean assigning and de-assigning knobs,
  which is a patch edit per frame; see the next point for why that is a non-starter.

- **Structural edits in rapid succession, at all.** The acked queue in
  `ConnectionManager` exists because they freeze the synth, and that is not theoretical:
  the first cut of cable re-routing (#67) sent a `CableDelete` and a `CableInsert` back
  to back for a gesture that changed nothing, and froze a real G1 (2026-08-17). Budget:
  MIDI DIN is 31250 baud, ~3125 bytes/s, a cable or knob-assignment message is ~10-12
  bytes, and the synth is already streaming Lights and Meters over the same wire. Any
  feature that would send structural edits at animation rates is out.

### Protocol Behavior
- Request/response pattern with **3-second timeout**
- ACK messages confirm operations (type=0x7f for completion)
- Patch data split across multiple SysEx messages with first/last flags
- All data uses 7-bit encoding for MIDI compatibility
- Checksum = `sum(all bytes from F0 through last payload byte) % 128` — **includes F0 and 0x33**
- Not all messages have checksums: IAm (cc=0x00) has none; Parameter (0x13), PatchHandling (0x17) do

### Patch Retrieval Flow

To retrieve the full patch currently loaded in a slot:

**Step 1** — Send `RequestPatch` (cc=0x17, pp=0x41, ssc=0x35). Synth ACKs with a `patchId`.

**Step 2** — Send 13 `GetPatch` messages (cc=0x17, PatchModification: pid + section code + payload). The synth responds to each with a `PatchPacket` (cc=0x1c–0x1f, where the 2 LSBs encode first/last packet flags).

| # | Section | sc | Description |
|---|---------|-----|-------------|
| 1 | Header | 0x20 or 0x28 | Voice config, portamento, octave shift |
| 2 | ModuleDump (poly) | 0x4b, section=1 | Module list for poly voice area |
| 3 | ModuleDump (common) | 0x4b, section=0 | Module list for common voice area |
| 4 | CableDump (poly) | 0x53, section=1 | Cable connections (poly) |
| 5 | CableDump (common) | 0x53, section=0 | Cable connections (common) |
| 6 | ParameterDump (poly) | 0x4c, section=1 | All parameter values (poly) |
| 7 | ParameterDump (common) | 0x4c, section=0 | All parameter values (common) |
| 8 | MorphMap | 0x66 | Morph assignments |
| 9 | KnobMapDump | 0x63 | 23 knob-to-parameter assignments |
| 10 | ControlMapDump | 0x61 | MIDI CC-to-parameter mappings |
| 11 | NameDump (poly) | 0x4e, section=1 | Module names (poly) |
| 12 | NameDump (common) | 0x4e, section=0 | Module names (common) |
| 13 | NoteDump | 0x68 | Note event data |

**Important**: Each PatchPacket response is independently 7-bit encoded — you cannot concatenate raw bytes across packets. Decode each packet separately. The first PatchPacket (Header request) contains both Header (type=33) and PatchName2 (type=39).

### Uploading a Patch (Editor -> Synth)

The reverse direction is **not** the download run backwards. The whole patch goes up as **one
continuous byte stream**, not as one packet per section:

- The 16 sections are laid end to end (each is byte-aligned, so they concatenate cleanly) and the
  result is cut into packets of **at most 166 decoded bytes**. Each packet is 7-bit encoded on its
  own, which puts a full one at 197 bytes of SysEx.
- `cc` = `0x1c | first | 2*last`, where **first marks only the very first packet of the transfer**
  and **last only the very final one** — not each section. A section may straddle a packet
  boundary, and a small packet may finish several sections.
- The `pid` field carries `command=1` in its top bit and, below it, **how many sections end inside
  that packet** (0 for a middle chunk of a long section). This is what `libnmprotocol`'s
  `PatchMessage(BitStream, PositionList)` does; `jnmprotocol2` sends a cumulative section index
  instead, and the synth accepts both, so it does not appear to be load-bearing.
- Each packet is ACKed before the next goes out.

**The 166-byte limit is real**: the synth answers an oversized packet with `sc=0x7e code=4`
(checksum error) even though the checksum is correct, and the transfer dies. Sending each section
as its own packet works only until a section grows past roughly a kilobyte, which a ~99-module
patch's NameDump does (issue #39).

**An aborted upload must be closed.** The synth stays in bulk-receive state until it sees a packet
flagged `last`, and while it is parked there it answers *nothing*: no ACKs, no reply to IAm, not
even the idle Lights/VoiceCount stream. It looks like dead hardware. Sending one terminating
packet (`cc` with the last bit, empty payload) releases it — no power cycle needed (issue #40).

### Section Binary Formats (from PDL2 spec)

**ParameterDump** — all parameter values for one voice area:
```
ParameterDump := section:1 nmodules:7 nmodules*Parameter
Parameter     := index:7 type:7 <type-specific params>
```
Each module's parameters are keyed by `type` (77 distinct layouts, types 3–127). **Parameter bit widths vary per module type** — e.g., OscA (type 7) uses `[7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1]` bits. You must build a lookup table from the PDL2 spec; writing all params as 7-bit will silently corrupt data.

**KnobMapDump** — which parameters are assigned to the 23 physical knobs:
```
KnobMapDump    := Knob * 23
Knob           := assigned:1 assigned*KnobAssignment
KnobAssignment := section:2 module:7 parameter:7
```
Each knob is either unassigned (1 bit = 0) or assigned (1 + 2 + 7 + 7 = 17 bits) to a specific section/module/parameter.

**ControlMapDump** — MIDI CC number to parameter mappings:
```
ControlMapDump := ncontrols:7 ncontrols*Control
Control        := control:7 section:2 module:7 parameter:7
```

**MorphMap** — morph source assignments:
```
MorphMap := 4*MorphValue  KeyboardAssignment  nentries:7 nentries*MorphEntry
MorphValue := value:7
MorphEntry := section:2 module:7 parameter:7 morphIndex:2 range:8
```

### 7-Bit Encoding

All patch data is 7-bit encoded for MIDI compatibility. This is **not** the usual MIDI scheme of one
MSB byte carrying the high bits of the next seven: a section is a *bitstream*, and the encoding is a
straight repack of that bitstream into 7-bit groups.

```
Bitstream:  b0 b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 | b7 b8 b9 b10 b11 b12 b13 | ...
Encoded:    0bbbbbbb              0bbbbbbb                    ...   (MSB of each byte always 0)
```

- Take the bits most significant first and emit one MIDI data byte per 7 bits.
- A trailing group of fewer than 7 bits is **left-justified** (shifted up, zero-padded on the right),
  never right-justified.
- The bitstream itself is padded to a multiple of 8 bits first (the PDL2 "Section % 8" rule), and the
  decoder truncates the recovered bits back to a byte boundary, discarding the tail padding.

Implementations: `BitStreamWriter::toMidiBytes()` encodes, `BitStream`'s constructor decodes, and
`UploadPacketizer::pack7Bit()` does the same repack starting from whole bytes rather than loose bits.

**Where the packing happens differs by direction.** On download each PatchPacket is encoded, and so
must be decoded, independently. On upload the sections are concatenated as plain bytes first
(`BitStreamWriter::toBytes()`) and the 7-bit packing is applied per *packet*, after the 166-byte cut,
so it does not align with section boundaries at all.

## 9. Build Notes

### Running Original (v0.3)
```bash
cd /mnt/SPEED/CODE/Nomad2026/nomad-0-3_2
/mnt/SPEED/CODE/Nomad2026/jdk8u482-b08/bin/java -jar nomad.jar
```
- Requires Java 8 (JPF 1.5.1 incompatible with Java 9+)
- JDK 8 portable installed at: `jdk8u482-b08/`

### Original Build System
- C/C++ libraries: Autotools (configure, make)
- Java libraries: Apache Ant
- Dependencies: TCL 8.x, Flex, Bison, SWIG, SCons (for legacy C/C++)

### Animatek NME macOS Compatibility
- The JUCE version vendored by the project supports deployment targets as old
  as macOS 10.11. The reproducible release target is macOS 10.13 High Sierra,
  the oldest version also supported by the Xcode 16.4 toolchain used in CI.
- `CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` is defaulted before `project()` in the root
  `CMakeLists.txt`, so both local and CI builds inherit the Mojave target.
- The generated app bundle explicitly writes that value to
  `LSMinimumSystemVersion`; JUCE's generated plist does not add the key unless
  it is supplied through `PLIST_TO_MERGE`.
- Release builds are universal (`x86_64` and `arm64`). High Sierra and Mojave
  use the Intel slice; Apple Silicon Macs use the native arm64 slice.
- The CI job is pinned to the `macos-15` runner and Xcode 16.4 because that
  toolchain can deploy to macOS 10.13-15. Xcode 26 raises its macOS deployment
  floor to macOS 11 and therefore cannot produce the High Sierra-compatible
  slice.
- Reaching JUCE's theoretical macOS 10.11 floor would require a separate Intel
  legacy build made with Xcode 12 or 13 on a compatible self-hosted Mac. GitHub's
  current hosted runners do not provide that toolchain, and Xcode 14+ does not
  support deployment targets below macOS 10.13.
- CI verifies both `LSMinimumSystemVersion` in the app bundle and the Intel
  Mach-O deployment target, preventing packaging metadata from claiming a
  newer minimum by accident.
